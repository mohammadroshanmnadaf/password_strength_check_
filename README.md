# password_strength_check_


## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this project is to **understand what makes a password strong** and evaluate password strength using online tools.  
By testing multiple passwords with varying complexity, we identify best practices and learn how password complexity improves security.

## ðŸ›  Tools
- [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com/) â€“ Free online password strength checker
- [HaveIbeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)- Verify that the passwords has been 
  appeared in any real data breaches.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- 'Report on passwords.pdf' 
- 'Screenshots of test.pdf'

## ðŸ’¡ Tips Learned (Best Practices)
1. **Length matters** â€“ use at least 12â€“16 characters.  
2. **Mix character types** â€“ uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
3. **Avoid common words & patterns** â€“ e.g: 'password123'.  
4. **Use passphrases** â€“ a mix of unrelated words or modified phrases.  
5. **Donâ€™t reuse passwords** across multiple accounts.  
6. **Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for added security.

## ðŸ“Š How Password Complexity Affects Security
- **Short & simple passwords** are easily guessed within seconds using automated tools.  
- **Adding length** exponentially increases the time required for brute force attacks.  
- **Adding variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)** forces attackers to try more combinations, making cracking harder.  
- **Randomness & unpredictability** reduce the risk from dictionary-based and pattern-based attacks.  
- **Result:** The more complex and longer a password, the stronger the protection against both brute force and dictionary attacks.  

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
Password complexity directly impacts security:  
- Weak passwords = quick compromise.  
- Strong passwords = significantly improved defense against brute force, dictionary, and reuse attacks.  

This task demonstrates how password strength tools can guide users to create safer, more resilient passwords.
